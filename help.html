This bot gets the most recent setlist for an artist. Just send in the band name and you will get the latest setlist from setlist.fm database.

To get multiple recent setlists for an artist, please type in the extra number with plus after the artist name, e.g:

Iron Maiden <b>+2</b>

This will get a total of up to 3 most recent setlists by the mighty Iron Maiden. Should be handy when the most recent show was a small festival appearance or the setlist.fm records are incomplete.

The following other commands are supported by the bot:

/help - this help message
/whatsnew - changelog for the most recent updates
